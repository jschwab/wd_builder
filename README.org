* MESA WD Model Builder
This work directory is a prototype of using the
~other_build_initial_model~ hook to make a WD.

The code's not great, but mostly seems to work.

** Options
*** ~x_ctrl(1)~
This sets the initial central temperature of the WD.  
 
*** ~x_logical_ctrl(1)~
If true, this reads the composition from ~relax_composition_filename~
in ~star_job~.   

If false, it the subroutine ~get_xa_from_code~ in
~src/model_builder.f90~ is called.  This routine must provide the
composition as a function of q.

*** ~x_logical_ctrl(2)~

If false, this assumes the coordinate in ~relax_composition_filename~
is xq (= 1 - q).  That is the format typically assumed by
~relax_initial_composition~.

If true, this assumes the coordinate in ~relax_composition_filename~
is q.  The included file ~composition_test.dat~ uses q and
~mesa_49.net~.
